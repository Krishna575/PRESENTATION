## Normal Distribution and Log-Normal Distribution

This section summarizes key concepts presented during an academic presentation on Normal Distribution and Log-Normal Distribution, highlighting their definitions, properties, and real-world applications.

### Normal Distribution
The Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean and forms a bell-shaped curve. It is fully characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal, and most data values are concentrated around the mean.

Key characteristics:
- Symmetric, bell-shaped curve
- Mean = Median = Mode
- Defined over the range −∞ to +∞
- Controlled by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)

Examples: Heights of individuals, examination scores, measurement errors.

### Log-Normal Distribution
A Log-Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution in which the logarithm of the variable follows a normal distribution. If the natural logarithm of a random variable is normally distributed, then the variable itself is log-normally distributed. This distribution is positively skewed and takes only positive values.

Key characteristics:
- Values are always positive
- Right-skewed distribution
- Mean > Median > Mode
- Common in multiplicative growth processes

Examples: Income distribution, stock prices, time taken to complete tasks, biological growth.

### Comparison Between Normal and Log-Normal Distributions

| Aspect | Normal Distribution | Log-Normal Distribution |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Shape | Symmetric | Right-skewed |
| Value Range | −∞ to +∞ | 0 to +∞ |
| Mean, Median, Mode | Equal | Mean > Median > Mode |
| Data Nature | Additive | Multiplicative |

### Conclusion
Normal distribution is used to model data that varies evenly around an average value, while log-normal distribution is suitable for data that grows proportionally and cannot take negative values. Both distributions are widely used in statistics, data science, and real-world modeling.
